# Introduction Parallel

Reference:

- Introduction to Parallel Computing
- C++ Concurrency in Action

## What

Requirements:

- CXX compiler support C++17
- MPI
- OpenMP
- Google Test

There are two types of code: homework and exercise.

- Homework: `homework/` directory. Implement the Histogram Bin, the Trapezoidal Rule, and the Monte Carlo Pi by using MPI, OpenMP, and C++ Standard Library.TODO: Matrix Multiplication and N-Body Simulation.

- Exercise: `exercise/` directory. Just for practice. Implementation: Global sum with Broadcast, Reduce and Allreduce by tree-structure and butterfly-structure. Thread safe structure: stack,queue,extendable hash table, and thread pool.
